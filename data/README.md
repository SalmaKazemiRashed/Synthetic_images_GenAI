## A generative image project focused on high-content fluorescence microscopy, designed to generate full cell images using only the nuclei channel.
## Data

This project focuses on generating the cell channel of a fluorescence microscopy dataset from the nuclei channel to address a batch of missing data. The dataset is shared on Zenodo, with nuclei and cell data described at [nuclei](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340922009726) and [Cell](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340924011107).
